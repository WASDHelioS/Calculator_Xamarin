Calculator_Xamarin

Extremely WIP. At the moment the program takes a string input (input via buttons on screen), and dumps that string in a Datatable for calculation. Pretty ugly stuff.
Need to change the way calculation works, probably by splitting the string input. The hard part seems to be operator priority ( () > * > / > + > -).
